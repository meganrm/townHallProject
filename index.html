              <p class="lead">Town Hall Project empowers constituents across the country to have face-to-face conversations with their elected representatives. We are campaign veterans and first time volunteers. We come from a diversity of backgrounds and live across the country. We share progressive values and believe strongly in civic engagement. We research every district and state for public events with members of Congress. Then we share our findings to promote participation in the democratic process.</p>
              <p class="lead">This movement is diverse, open source, and powered by citizens. We are proud to be a part of it.</p>

                <h3>About the Events</h3>
                <p>Our project is currently focused on federal elected officials. We strongly believe that state legislatures deserve attention and citizen engagement, but at the moment these events are outside our current mission.</p>

                <p>Our event listing includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Town halls</li>
                  <li>Other public events with members of Congress in their district/state</li>
                  <li>Ticketed events in the district/state</li>
                  <li>Staff office hours</li>
                  <li>Opportunities in Washington, D.C. to speak with your representative</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We do not currently include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fundraisers outside the district/state</li>
                  <li>Inappropriate events to ask policy questions (e.g. funerals)</li>
                  <li>Campaign events where the member will not take questions</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>What to expect</h3>
                <p>The most powerful thing you can do, as a constituent, is ask an earnest, pressing question on an issue close to you. <strong>Your personal story is incredibly valuable.</strong> It’s precisely how sometimes dry policy is connected with the lives of real people. It’s not always easy to speak up, but these times call for courage in all of us. Take the mic and tell your representative why she or he needs to act in your best interest.</p>
                <p>The Town Hall Project strongly encourages you to only attend and ask questions of your own representatives. Remember that any town hall has limited time, and a question you take is one less question for a constituent.</p>

                <h3>Why Town Halls</h3>
                <p>There is no better way to influence your representatives than in-person conversations. Town halls are a longstanding American tradition--where our elected representatives must listen and respond to the concerns of their constituents. Remember: you are their boss.</p>
                <p>We believe every citizen, no matter the party of their members of Congress, should have the opportunity to speak with his or her representatives.</p>
                <p>You have more power than you think. Town halls are one of the most effective ways to use it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Our Supporters</h3>
                <p>Town Hall Project is possible because of the hard work of researchers, organizers, and developers across country, and the generous support of hundreds of grassroots donors.</p>
                <p>We are also proud to partner with <a href="//www.americanprogressaction.org/resistance-near-me/" target="_blank">CAP Action</a>, <a href="//www.resistancerecess.com/event/resistance-aprilrecess/search/" target="_blank">MoveOn.org</a>, <a href="//nextgenclimate.org/" target="_blank">NextGen Climate</a>, and other progressive allies in supporting grassroots action to hold our elected officials accountable.</p>

To have even more impact, join with other citizens in your district or state and organize group efforts. Visit the district office together, deliver petitions, inform your local press, or even hold an “Empty Chair” town hall and invite your member of Congress to fill that chair.</p>
